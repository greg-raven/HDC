We cycle in the high desert region of California --- an area including Apple Valley, Adelanto, Hesperia, Victorville, and Lucerne Valley.

With our great weather, low traffic, and incredible scenery, this area has the potential to be a fantastic area for cycling, as it is for other outdoor activities.

High Desert Cycling is working with federal, state, and local groups and authorities to improve conditions for cyclists. We have a long way to go to make our communities bike friendly, but there are plenty of great examples we can follow.
