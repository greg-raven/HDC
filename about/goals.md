We have a multi-step plan we’d like to see implemented:

1. Connect all parks and schools with bike lanes or paths;

2. Connect all existing and future bike lanes and paths to each other;

3. Encourage cities in the high desert to cooperate with each other to ensure bike lanes don’t end at city limits;

4. Convert South Outer Hwy 18 to one-way going east, North Outer Hwy 18 to one-way going west, and use this as a central spine through Apple Valley to promote cycling and other forms of exercise;

5. Encourage local schools, parks, and businesses to offer bike racks;

6. Become recognized as a Bike-Friendly Community by the [League of American Bicyclists](https://www.bikeleague.org/); and

7. Incorporate our bike system with the [U.S. Bicycle Route System](https://www.adventurecycling.org/).
