The American Automobile Association (AAA) wants Congress to cut funds that support trail, biking and walking programs in order to funnel that money to the highway system. AAA has forgotten that bicyclists and pedestrians drive, support AAA, pay gas taxes and want balanced transportation systems that provide the choice to get around in a variety of ways.  
  
Sign the [Rails-to-Trails petition](https://www.railstotrails.org) to tell AAA that you are one of tens of millions of Americans who want safe, convenient places to bicycle and walk. AAA, be a part of America’s transportation future!

Say YES to the federal programs that fund all ways of getting around — including trails, bicycling and walking!
