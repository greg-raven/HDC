To whom it may concern: As of this morning I have resigned from the board of the Hanson Cycling Foundation (HCF), and from this point on will have no official activities or duties regarding events staged by HCF, including but not limited to the upcoming Tour de Apple Valley this Saturday, October 19th.  
  
I will continue to promote local cycling and cycling safety. However, I can no longer do so while being associated with HCF.
