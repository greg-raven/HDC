After pondering how many flats I typically get while cycling around the High Desert, I realized what my New Year's Cycling Resolution should be.  
  
I've been getting a flat about once for every three rides.

Therefore, I resolve to check my tires for stickers and other puncturing objects each time after I return home. I'm already wiping down my chain, so an extra minute or two spent checking the tires might help catch a thorn that's embedded into the tire, but not yet made it through the tube.

I don't know if it ever works that way, but it's so discouraging to get kitted up for a ride, and then go out to find one or more flats awaiting your arrival.
