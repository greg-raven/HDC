The north end of Navajo Road, just south of Johnson Road, is torn up for construction.

During non-work hours (early morning, late afternoon, weekends), this means you'll have to traverse several yards of packed dirt and rocks. During work hours, there may be heavy equipment on the road, with flagmen.

Johnson Road seems unaffected by this work.
