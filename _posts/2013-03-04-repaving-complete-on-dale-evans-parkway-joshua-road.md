Repaving is complete on Dale Evans Parkway between Johnson Road and the I-15, as well as on Joshua Road between CA 18 and Standing Rock Road.

Neither road has been widened, nor made specifically more bike-friendly, but the resurfacing is good news nevertheless. On Dale Evans Parkway, riding south from Stoddard Wells Road to Johnson Road means that while you still have to deal with the big rigs, you don't have to dodge potholes and other pavement problems while doing so.

On Joshua Road, the biggest area of improvement is at the south end, at the stop sign. Previously, it was somewhat of a challenge to negotiate the deep grooves in the road while trying to look for cross traffic on Highway 18 and merge at the same time.
