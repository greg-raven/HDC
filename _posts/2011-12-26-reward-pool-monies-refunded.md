All PayPal donations for the reward pool have been returned to the donor. In the case of donations by check, the checks have been shredded.  
  
The monies raised for the reward pool were to be awarded to anyone having information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons involved in a hit-and-run accident involving local cyclists.

However, it did not seem that anyone had earned the reward, bank fees were gradually eating into the balance, and then there was the matter of how to declare these monies on my income tax. The best approach seemed to be to return each donation and avoid any complications.

Thanks to each person who contributed. It was gratifying to see the response of the local cycling community to this near tragedy.
