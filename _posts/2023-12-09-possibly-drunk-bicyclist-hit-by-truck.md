HESPERIA, Calif. (VVNG) Witnesses believe that alcohol may have played a role in an accident Friday morning involving a bicyclist and a truck.

Witnesses told Victor Valley News that a man on a bike attempted to dart across traffic before being hit by the truck just before 7:00 a.m., near Ranchero Road and Topaz Avenue.

A bottle of Fireball Whiskey was reportedly tossed out by the bicyclist into a nearby bush after getting up from the ground.

He was taken by a ground ambulance to Desert Valley Medical Center for treatment of what were described as minor injuries. No one else was hurt.

The driver of the classic Chevy truck, Mike Valdez, 5o, an Oak Hills resident, remained on scene and waited for authorities to arrive.

The driver was on his way to babysit his grandchildren in Hesperia and told Victor Valley News “the man was laying on the ground, I thought he was dead so I started praying, then he just got up and started walking around.”

The name of the 33-year-old bicyclist was not released, just that he was a resident of Victorville.
