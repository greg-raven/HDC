HESPERIA --- A 33-year-old bicyclist was transported to a local hospital after a Friday morning collision on Ranchero Road.

Authorities responded to the collision near Topaz Avenue a little before 7 a.m., California Highway Patrol spokesman Matt Hunt said.

San Bernardino County Fire Department personnel found the bicyclist in the road and transferred him to Desert Valley Hospital with minor injuries, according to spokesman Peter McKernan.

A Hesperia Unified School District officer was on scene at approximately 7:30 a.m., along with two pickup trucks, on the side of the road. There was also significant amount of shattered glass on the road. However, traffic was flowing smoothly near the scene at 7:30 a.m.

Hunt said the bicyclist, a Victorville resident, was riding on Topaz Avenue and was struck by a westbound 1965 Chevrolet C-10 on Ranchero Road driven by a 50-year-old Oak Hills man. Hunt said the man served to the right but was unable to avoid the collision.
The crash remained under investigation Friday afternoon, Hunt said.
