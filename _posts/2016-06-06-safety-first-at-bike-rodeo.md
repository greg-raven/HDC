The Victor Valley Bicycle Tour hosted a free children’s Bicycle Road-eo on Saturday at Victor Valley College’s lower campus. The event stressed bicycle safety, and upon successful completion of a short course, each elementary-aged child received a free helmet and was entered into a raffle to win one of 11 new bikes.
