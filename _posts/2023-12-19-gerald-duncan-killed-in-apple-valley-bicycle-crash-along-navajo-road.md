- Tuesday evening crash leaves bicyclist dead

APPLE VALLEY, CA, (December 19, 2023) --- Authorities have released the identity of a bicyclist hit and killed by a vehicle on a busy roadway in Apple Valley. The incident happened around 5:48 p.m. Tuesday near Navajo and Ottawa roads, according to the sheriff’s officials.

A preliminary investigation revealed that a white 2016 Chevrolet Colorado was traveling in the No. 1 southbound lane of Navajo Road, approaching Ottawa Road. At the same time, Gerald Duncan was riding his bicycle west across Navajo Road when he was hit by the Chevrolet, authorities said.

Sadly, Duncan, 66, of Apple Valley, sustained major injuries and died at the scene.

Anyone with information about the case is urged to call the Apple Valley sheriff’s station at (760) 240-7400.

The incident remains under investigation.

**BICYCLE CRASH INVESTIGATION**

Our roads pose a unique danger for bicycle riders. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 854 cyclists died in accidents with motor vehicles, accounting for 2 percent of traffic fatalities.

“Bicyclists are particularly vulnerable on the road, and many factors can contribute to serious crashes,” said Candice Bond, a Managing Partner with Bond Legal and an experienced bicycle accident attorney.

“It is imperative to come to a determination of the exact cause of these types of accidents. An attorney has the resources to review applicable insurance coverage, hire expert witnesses, run background checks, and locate witnesses. We carefully guide the family of the victim through the process.”

Bond noted that in cases such as this, it is important to have an independent investigation conducted sooner than later to preserve any evidence.

“In addition to a police report, an attorney will carefully review what may have contributed to the crash,” said Bond.

**WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM**

Pending the results of any investigations, the family members of Gerald Duncan may be entitled to a wrongful death claim. Survivors of wrongful death victims may seek damages for loss of companionship, pain and suffering, and emotional distress following a catastrophic accident.

Stefano Formica, of counsel at Bond Legal, said, “Grieving families of victims are sometimes overwhelmed by the legal processes that are in place to protect their rights.”

“An attorney can be a valuable and compassionate resource to help guide a family during this difficult time, and ensure that those left behind receive the restitution they are entitled to.”
