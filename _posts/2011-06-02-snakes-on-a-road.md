Now that the weather is supposedly getting better (for those who don’t consider wind to be part of “the weather”), you’ve probably read stories about how we’re going to have another bumper crop of snakes.  
  
Well, here’s a heads-up: I saw a juvenile rattler on Johnson Road this morning.

I realize that one small snake does not a plane-full of snakes make, but it’s probably a good idea to watch where you’re going this summer. I was surprised how well the brown colors of the snake blended in with the gray of the asphalt until I was almost on top of it.
