HESPERIA --- A 12-year-old boy suffered major injuries when his bicycle collided with a car in the area of Buckthorn and G avenues on Tuesday afternoon, San Bernardino County Fire Department officials said.

It was the third traffic collision involving a juvenile on a bicycle in Hesperia in less than a week.

San Bernardino County Sheriff's and Fire Department personnel responded to the scene at approximately 3:15 p.m.

The boy was airlifted to Loma Linda University Medical Center with unspecified serious injuries.

The driver of the car remained at the scene and was uninjured.

The incident was under investigation, and further details were not available as of Tuesday evening.

Two hit-and-run collisions involving teen boys on bicycles were reported in Hesperia within the past week, including the Monday crash that killed 17-year-old Daniel Sanchez of Hesperia.
