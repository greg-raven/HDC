CalTrans has a crew out power-sweeping the “bike lane” on the south side of Hwy 18 through Apple Valley --- finally. With any luck, they’ll do the whole thing, both sides, through Apple Valley, so those of us with skinny tires don’t have to venture into the traffic lanes to avoid all the debris in the emergency/bike lane that’s been there since the last resurfacing.
