As the new year approaches, several new traffic safety laws --- including two aimed at bicyclists and teenage drivers --- could help make High Desert roadways safer for residents as they take effect in 2014, California Highway Patrol spokesman Matt Hunt said.  
  
"Safety on the roadways here in the High Desert is paramount every year and the CHP is always striving to keep our California motorists safe," Hunt said.

Assembly Bill 1371, known as the Three Feet for Safety Act, takes affect on Sept. 16 and prohibits motorists from passing a bicycle with less than 3 feet between any part of the vehicle and any part of the bicycle or driver.

If 3 feet isn't possible, the motor vehicle must slow to a reasonable speed and pass only when it's safe and no danger is present to the bicyclist. Failure to comply could result in a fine to the motorist regardless if there's a collision.
