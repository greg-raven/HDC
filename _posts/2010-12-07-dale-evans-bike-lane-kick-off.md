Bring your bike as we ride the Dale Evans Parkway bike lane. Meet at the [Lenny Brewster Sports Center, 21024 Otoe Road](https://goo.gl/BB4yg) on March 24th at 6:30 pm. The ride starts at 6:45 pm. The ride will be to Waalew Road and back. Helmets are a must.

Note that this ride doesn't even begin until *after* civil twilight. The ride won't be that long, so you shouldn't need lights, but if you want to combine this kick-off ride into a longer ride, you'll need to take this into account.
