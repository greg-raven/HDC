At a pre-preliminary court conference today, Michael Bruce Slusser withdrew his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of “no contest” in the hit-and-run of two local cyclists pursuant to a plea deal reached with prosecutors.  
  
Slusser is accused of hitting local cyclist [Tim “TJ” Moreno](https://www.hdcycling.org/2011/06/hit-and-run-on-apple-valley-road/ "Hit-and-run on Apple Valley Road"). Fellow cyclist Steve Stearns was also injured in the collision. It is believed that Slusser was under the influence at the time he hit Moreno, and that his wife — who was in the truck at the time of the collision — provided authorities with information.

Sentencing has been scheduled for April 10th at 8:30 in Department V6 (case number FVI1101780).
