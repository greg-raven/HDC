The Town of Apple Valley has been doing a lot of slurry seal work. Bear Valley Road, Outer Highway 18, Thunderbird, and a bunch of smaller streets are getting the treatment.

This has two ramifications for cyclists:

First, all lane markers --- including bike lane markers --- are gone until they restripe the roads.

Second, although the slurry seal process is great for filling in cracks and small gaps in the roadway, the uniform-looking newly blackened surface hides bumps, which are not mitigated by the slurry seal process.
