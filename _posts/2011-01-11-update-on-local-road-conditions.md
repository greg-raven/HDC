Although the adverse road conditions created by the recent storms werenâ€™t too bad, they were widespread enough that road crews have yet to get everything cleaned up fully. Be prepared for small patches of sand, dirt, and gravel.  
  
One storm-related road hazard that is now cropping up involves deep deposits of dirt and sand. There is one such example on Navajo Road, south of Johnson Road. The problem is that these occasional deposits are still thick, but have dried out since the rains. When they were wet (or at least damp), it was possible to ride over them without too much drama. Now that they are dry, though, your tires sink in and this can cause loss of control.

If you have problems in these conditions, consider walking your bike over the deposits.
