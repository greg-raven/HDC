VICTORVILLE --- A Victorville man was sentenced Friday to 11 years in prison for the hit-and-run crash that killed an Apple Valley bicyclist two years ago.

Jason Thomas Scott, 28, agreed to plead no contest to vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence as part of a plea bargain reached last month. The case’s prosecutor, Carrie Halgrimson, said a hit-and-run enhancement on the felony charge pushed Scott’s sentence from six to 11 years.

“He admitted the enhancement to the hit-and-run as well,” Halgrimson said. “It attaches to the charge … gives you the sentencing benefit of the hit-and-run.”

As part of the deal reached March 7, separate charges of hit-and-run resulting in injury or death and driving on a license suspended due to driving under the influence were dropped, court records show.

Scott was behind the wheel on June 13, 2012, when he struck 27-year-old David Epperson, a Granite Hills High graduate who was walking his bicycle along Ridgecrest Road in Spring Valley Lake. Scott dragged Epperson more than 60 feet before leaving him to die, according to Epperson’s mother, Deborah.

“(Scott) took a boy that was loved by so many people (and) he broke so many hearts --- not just mine,” Deborah Epperson said. “But when he killed my son, he killed me. He killed my life.”

The death of her son spurred Deborah Epperson to write a letter to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, she said. Authorities previously said Scott was intoxicated at the time of the crash.

In the letter, Deborah Epperson wonders what Scott will make of the situation moving forward.

“My question now is, it’s too late for my son, but it’s not too late for this young man sitting in prison,” she said. “What are you going to do with your life? My young man’s life is gone, but this man’s isn’t. What are you going to do with your life? That’s my question to Jason Thomas Scott.”

Scott has already served nearly two years in jail. With credits for time served and good conduct, he will spend roughly 31/2 more years behind bars.

“My heart goes out to (Scott’s) family too,” Deborah Epperson said. “There were two families affected by this, not just one.”
