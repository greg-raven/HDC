We’ve changed the website over from “static” pages to “dynamically-generated” pages, using WordPress. Obviously, the site appears much different, but the main goal of the transfiguration was not appearance but functionality: With any luck the new incarnation will prove to be easier to maintain and better for visitors such as yourself.  
  
The downsides are that we lose a bit of flexibility, and there may be cases where old content doesn’t appear, or doesn’t appear as it should. If you run into any glitches with the site, please bear with us, and send us an e-mail telling us what you saw that didn’t look right, and/or links that don’t work.

Thanks for your patience and understanding.
