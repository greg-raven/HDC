*Bicycling* magazine has a win-a-bike competition going. To enter, you have to parody the writing of Bill Strickland, one of its regular writers.

Here's my entry:

> Eddy was going to ride --- when I rode with them. Off Vera Cruz, he said afterward over expressos. Instead, I turn before I emerge onto Sixth and head uphill once more. This time, one of the local pros blurred by. The handlebar instantly whipped sideways.
>
> Bobby appeared beside me, said, "Hey, you stuck in there for that second one, didn't you? You killed yourself." Afterward the ragged field came by and ended up having a good day, a few more hours, down that hill and up the hill. We ride together so much because I admire this quality.
>
> I thought again about this cathedral of a great ride, and choosing the wrong gear for the love of being where they dangle swelling at the back with him gagging and spitting. I was in a 12-year-old girls' sports multiverse coinciding with a smooth pop of power to the drivetrain.

Update July 2014: Incredibly, this was not the winning entry.
