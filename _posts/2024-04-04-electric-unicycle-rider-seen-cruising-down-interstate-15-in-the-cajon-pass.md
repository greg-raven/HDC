It’s not every day that you see someone riding an electric unicycle on Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass.

Brian Smith said that at around 1:20 p.m. on Tuesday, he was southbound on I-15 near Highway 138 when he passed a helmeted rider on an electric unicycle or EUC.

“I was making my way to work and I saw what I thought was a street bike on the side of the freeway doing a wheelie,” Smith told the Daily Press. “Once I got up next to him, I realized it was some crazy guy on a one-wheeler.”

Based on Smith’s vehicle speed of about 50 mph on the freeway, the unicyclist was traveling about 30 to 40 mph along the right shoulder of I-15.

“I was thinking — man, I hope he doesn’t hit a crack in the road and fall off because he’ll be dead for sure,” Smith said.

California law considers electric unicycles as electrically motorized boards, which are considered legal on roads coinciding with bicycles, which are illegal to ride on the interstate with few exceptions. A person riding an electric bicycle is subject to the same provisions as a person riding a bicycle, according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles.

It’s uncertain if the unicycle rider was identified or cited as the California Highway Patrol did not return messages on Tuesday.
