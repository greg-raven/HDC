January 10th, 2014, will see the start of the much-anticipated Yucca Loma Bridge, a project more than 40 years in the making. In December, the Town Council awarded a $37.3 million contract to Security Paving, Inc. for the construction of the Yucca Loma Bridge over the Mojave River and Yates Road improvements project. A ground-breaking ceremony is scheduled for Friday, January 10.

The contract will build the Yucca Loma Bridge, widen Yates Road from two lanes to four lanes, and construct new sound walls on the south side of Yates Road. Construction is estimated to last two years. Construction projects to widen Yucca Loma Road from the Yucca Loma Bridge to Apple Valley Road, and to extend Green Tree Boulevard from Hesperia Road to Ridgecrest Road, are currently in final design with construction planned for 2015, 2016, and 2017.

Once completed, and in concert with the recently-opened La Mesa/Nisquali Interchange, a new east-west regional transportation corridor will be realized in the Victory Valley, providing relief to existing and future anticipated traffic congestion on Bear Valley Road and State Route 18 (Happy Trails Highway).
