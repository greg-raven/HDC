On a recent trip south (AKA "down the hill"), I stopped by Peoplemovers in Orange, which sells all manner of bicycles, but mostly recumbents. Jim the owner gave me a handful of coupons good for $50 off on the purchase of a bike from them. So, if you are in the market for a recumbent and don't mind going to Orange, make certain you get one of these coupons from me first. If you do buy a bike, Jim will kick back a couple bucks to me, which will help offset the cost of maintaining this site.
