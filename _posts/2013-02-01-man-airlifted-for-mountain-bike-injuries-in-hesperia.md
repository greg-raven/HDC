HESPERIA --- An unidentified male was airlifted to Loma Linda University Medical Center after he fell from his mountain bike Friday afternoon, San Bernardino County sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Bachman said.

At 2:18 p.m., the Sheriff's Department initially received a call of a non-injury collision near Main Street and C Avenue, according to Bachman. People stopped to help the fallen rider before deputies arrived at the scene, she said.

"He had a fairly large laceration to his forehead," Bachman said. "He was unable to give the deputies any information."

It's unknown how he fell off the bike, she said. It didn't appear that the bike collided with a car.

No roads were closed due to the incident, according to Bachman.
