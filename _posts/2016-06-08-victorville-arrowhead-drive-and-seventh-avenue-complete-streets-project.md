Re: California Active Transportation Program (ATP) Cycle 3 --- City of Victorville Arrowhead Drive and Seventh Avenue Complete Streets Project

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing this letter of support on behalf of the City of Victorville for the City's Arrowhead Drive and Seventh Avenue Complete Streets project application with the California Active Transportation Program (ATP). I am in favor of the City's goals, and support facilitating pedestrian and bicycle use in building a healthier life style in the high desert.

High Desert Cycling promotes more and better cycling in the high desert, through road and bike path projects, safety training for cyclists, cycling events, and group rides. High Desert Cycling advocates working toward a connected system of bicycle lanes and paths that links cities, schools, parks, and that is integrated with the U.S. Bicycle Route System. Ultimately, I would like to see the high desert achieve recognition as being a Bike-Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists.

This project involves improvements to Arrowhead Drive and Seventh Avenue from Green Tree Boulevard to Bear Valley Road to construct Class II bike lanes, sidewalks, and ADA-compliant curb ramps. It will connect to the ATP Cycle 1-funded Safe Routes to School project on Seventh Avenue at Mojave Vista Elementary School and the ATP Cycle 2-funded bike lanes on Green Tree Boulevard. Without the improvements proposed, there are no safe facilities for walking or biking. The improvements will be another step toward a connected system in the high desert, which is a core part of our mission.

High Desert Cycling recognizes the many contributions city manager Doug Robertson has made toward our common objectives, and fully supports the City of Victorville as the City continues to establish ways to improve a healthier community, promote public safety, and encourage residents to ride bicycles or walk to foster a healthy future and lifestyle.

Sincerely,

Greg Raven
