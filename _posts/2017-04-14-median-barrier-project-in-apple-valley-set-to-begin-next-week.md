SAN BERNARDINO --- The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and Sully-Miller Contracting began work on a raised curb median project on State Route 18 (SR-18) in Apple Valley. The construction area is approximately .75 miles, with the project limits from Navajo Road to Kiowa Road. The $1.1 million construction plan was identified as a necessary safety project.

Beginning Monday, April 17th Sully Miller will begin excavation in the median area. The planned working hours are from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. for the north bound \[*sic*\] portion and 10:00 a.m. through 6:00 p.m. for the south bound \[sic\] portion. No night work is expected. Work will be limited on Friday for south bound motorists, and on Sunday for north bound travelers.

One lane will be open in each direction for the duration of the work, unless extenuating circumstances prevent this condition. The project is expected to last 60 working days, and is anticipated to be complete in Summer 2017. Left turn pockets at Navajo Road and Kiowa Road have been closed, but detours are available. Please follow all prescribed detours in the construction zone. Construction crews have placed temporary striping, channelizers, signage, and portable changeable message signs (CMS) to alert motorists of the temporary traffic pattern.
