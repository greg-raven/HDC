VICTORVILLE â€“ Children squealed in delight while each rode their new bicycles around the High Desert Event Center parking lot as the Victorville Parks and Recreation Department held its 13th annual Doris Davies Memorial Bicycle Giveaway Wednesday.

"I absolutely love my new bike," said 4-year-old Leaveh Johnson as she happily rode around the building.

The event, which is hosted by the nonprofit organization Benefit Everyone, Assist Recreation &amp; Sports, also known as BEARS drew a huge crowd of families as over 170 bicycles and helmets were given away to children who showed a need and did well in school.

"For a lot of these kids this could be the only Christmas present they receive and it's always so rewarding to see the smiles and excitement on these children's faces," said BEARS Trustee Terry Caldwell. "Doris was all about dedicating her time to the kids and it's wonderful to see her legacy live on."

The BEARS organization was started in 2003 when Doris Davies, the City of Victorville and the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Victorville Station refurbished 30 bicycles that were in the sheriff's station storage lockup. In 2008, Davies and BEARS started purchasing bicycles for the giveaway program.

Each child who received a bike was selected by elementary schools serving Victorville residents, with each school asked to select four boys and four girls between second and fifth grade.

Close to 13 sponsors and volunteers throughout the High Desert pitched in for the event as children were also visited by Santa and enjoyed cupcakes and free toys while The Doo Wah Riders played various Christmas songs for the crowd.

"It's a great event and my daughter was really excited to get her bike and she and I found a lot of familiar and friendly faces in the room from her school who also received bikes," said Cheyanna Sparks, 26, of Victorville. "This is a great way to spread some holiday cheer."
