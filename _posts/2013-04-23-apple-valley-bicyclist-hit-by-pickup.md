An Apple Valley bicyclist was taken to a local hospital with minor injuries after being hit by a pickup truck that ran a stop sign, California Highway Patrol officials said Tuesday.  
  
A call of a car colliding with a bicycle came into the CHP at 7:50 a.m. Monday, according to CHP spokesman Joaquin Zubieta.

Cody Hempel, 22, of Apple Valley, was riding his bicycle northbound on Joshua Road when he was hit by a 2008 Dodge truck driven by Carl Futch, 62, of Lucerne Valley, Zubieta said.

Zubieta said Hempel, who was wearing a helmet at the time of the incident, sustained minor injuries and was transported via ambulance to St. Joseph Health, St. Mary.
