This morning on Apple Valley Road around Symeron, a passing truck hit Tim "TJ" Moreno in the back of the head with its mirror. Moreno went down, taking Steve Stearns with him. Stearns "only" has major road rash; Moreno had to be taken to the hospital in Loma Linda.  
  
The driver of the truck pulled over, and then sped off. There was another vehicle behind the truck, and while it seemed as if it was chasing down the hit-and-run driver, it never returned. Police are looking for a black or green truck with right-side damage from the collision.

There's a lot of information about this on the [VVBC Facebook page](<https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=gr ... 83842&ap=1>).

Please keep TJ in your prayers, and be on the look-out for that truck. If you have any information about the truck or driver, call We Tip at 800-78-CRIME. If you want to text TJ, you may do so at 714-397-9639.
