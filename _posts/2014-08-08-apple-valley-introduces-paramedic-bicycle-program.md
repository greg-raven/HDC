APPLE VALLEY — The Apple Valley Fire Protection District has implemented the High Desert’s first and only bicycle paramedic program in an effort to improve response times and safety during crowded, outdoor events.

“Our community has always called on us to provide service and save money, so that’s exactly what we did,” AVFPD Chief Sid Hultquist said. “We don’t have to have a big, expensive fire truck on standby now, we can just have these guys go out on their bikes and take care of things.”

The program was rolled out during Apple Valley’s Freedom Festival on July 4 and proved itself to be useful in the confined spaces where children and large crowds posed a challenge for emergency vehicles.

The fire district, so far, has two bicycles that are equipped with full advanced life support gear, including defibrillators and first aid kits. Simpson said a firefighter EMT and firefighter paramedic work together as a unit on these bikes to respond to medical emergencies at these events faster than a fire truck or ambulance could. Simpson created a full class, written test and bike field test for the 20 paramedics and EMTs that ride the bicycles.

Hultquist said the program has been approved by San Bernardino County and the bikes and firefighters will be used for bicycle safety outreach programs and environmental awareness.

Simpson said the district “definitely” plans to expand the bicycle medics and will continue attending community events such as Concerts in the Park, the Mud Run at Horseman’s Center and National Night Out on Tuesday as well as high school sporting events.
