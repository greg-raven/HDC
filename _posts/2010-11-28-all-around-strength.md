The December 2010 issue of *Bicycling* magazine (pg. 46) had an article on how to work out to supplement your cycling. Unfortunately, the regimen and process discussed won’t be for everyone.  
  
If you are looking for whole-body fitness training (or even just a great work-out), check out TRX Training from [B-Fit Personal Training Center](http://www.crossfitbeehive.com "B-Fit Personal Training Center"), [12120 Ridgecrest Road Suite 204, Victorville, CA](http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&q=12120+Ridgecrest+Road+Suite+204,+Victorville,+CA&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=12120+Ridgecrest+Rd,+Victorville,+San+Bernardino,+California+92395&gl=us&t=h&z=16). The TRX system is not an improvised garage method, but a professional approach that works all your muscles but really targets your core. TRX workouts will not only keep you fit in the off season, but can improve your fitness all year around. Give them a call to get their schedule or make an appointment at 760-843-7600.
