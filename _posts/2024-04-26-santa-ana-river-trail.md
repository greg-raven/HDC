The Santa Ana River Trail Santa Ana River Trail will be extended in Redlands.

San Bernardino County approved a $6.8 million state grant Tuesday, April 23, to complete a stretch of the trail from California to Orange streets.

The grant will be used to design, construct, and complete a 3.9-mile portion of the trail, according to the county.

The project is part of the larger Santa Ana River Trail, a 110-mile path for cyclists and pedestrians that will eventually run from the sea to the mountains --- from Huntington Beach to the San Bernardino National Forest.

The trail is 60% complete, with two significant gaps, from Green River Road in Orange County to the Hidden Valley Wildlife area in Riverside County, and from Waterman Avenue in San Bernardino to the national forest boundary near Mentone.

The grant agreement is with the California State Coastal Conservancy. Work should be done by the end of January 2026.
