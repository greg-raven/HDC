The recent rains have left a lot of debris on the roads, but the road crews seem to be getting things cleaned up pretty quickly. You still have to pay attention to the deeper piles and sand, dirt, and mud, as the narrow tires commonly found on road bikes don't negotiate these too well. You also have to pay attention to the gravel that's washed out onto the roadway, as some of the pieces are sharp enough to slice your sidewalls.

Something you might not think about though, is that our current freezing overnight temperatures turn puddles of water into ice. If you think a fine coating of sand is slippery in a corner, wait until you experience ice on the roadway.

And while we're on the topic of the cold, watch out for hypothermia: Dress warmly!
