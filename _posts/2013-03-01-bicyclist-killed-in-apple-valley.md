A bicyclist was struck and killed Friday morning as he rode along a busy road in Apple Valley, according to San Bernardino County sheriff's officials.  
  
At approximately 10:13 a.m., sheriff's deputies from the Apple Valley station responded to a call of man on a bicycle who had been struck by a sports utility vehicle while riding along Apple Valley Road near Quantico Road, sheriff's spokeswoman Trish Hill wrote in a news release.

A Chevrolet Tahoe traveling north on Apple Valley Road struck bicyclist Kevin Olin, 56, who was also traveling north in the designated bike lane, the release stated.

Olin, of Apple Valley, died at the scene, according to the release.

According to Leslie Elliott, a friend and coworker of the victim, Olin was the current maintenance director for Our Lady of the Desert Catholic Church in Apple Valley. Olin had been with the church since its "early days."

Elliott --- who is the director for music and liturgy at Holy Innocents Catholic Church and the coordinator for World Youth Day at Our Lady of the Desert --- said that Olin rode his bike regularly for exercise and to care for the environment.

"Kevin had a wonderful sense of humor, but was also very serious about his faith, his care for his family, and his passion for environmental issues and social justice" Elliott, of Victorville, wrote in an email. "He is truly one of the most influential and admired people in my life, and I can honestly say what a huge loss his death is to our Catholic community and to the world at large."

"This man was a nice, friendly, great guy," Mark Shoup commented on Facebook. "Horrible tragedy and great loss to his family, and to our community."

Inattention may have contributed to the traffic collision, Hill wrote in the release.

The accident is under investigation by the Apple Valley Major Accident Investigation Team.
