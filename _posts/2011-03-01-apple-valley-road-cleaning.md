The street cleaner was out on Apple Valley Road yesterday, so the piece of gypsum board is gone from the SB bike lane, as is the "lick" of sand, rocks, and gravel on the NB side of the intersection with Keota. They seem not to have cleaned all the way down to Bear Valley Road, so there is still some debris and the odd section with broken glass, but overall, riding conditions are now much better.
