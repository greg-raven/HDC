*Hesperia mayor hopes people will 'come to ride and decide to stay' with return of BMX Park*

After 10 years without one, Hesperia finally has a bicycle motocross park again.

The national anthem played as 21-year-old Brad Orescanin rode the length of the track carrying the American flag during the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the BMX Park at Live Oak Park in Hesperia on Friday. His father, Pat Orescanin, 54, and fellow riders Devan Searle, 20, and Gavin Rodriguez, 4, rode beside him.
