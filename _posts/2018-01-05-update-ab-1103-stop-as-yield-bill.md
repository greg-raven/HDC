I just learned that the author has decided to pull the bill from the hearing because there were not enough supporting votes.  
  
This is very disappointing to me. I thought a bipartisan bill would have a good chance of passing. It was not to be. There's no doubt in my mind that this issue will be considered again in the future.

Thanks to all who offered their support.
