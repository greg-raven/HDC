HESPERIA • A 16-year-old boy who was struck while riding a bicycle and airlifted to a trauma center last week was released Monday night and is expected to make a full recovery, according to his grandmother.

Henry Chavez Jr., of Oak Hills, was struck by an unidentified white pickup truck while riding his younger sister’s pink Huffy bicycle along Mesquite Road near Mesa Vista Road in unincorporated Hesperia around 9 p.m. on June 27, according to his grandmother Denise Crow, of Oak Hills.

“He was very lucky,” Crow said. “They had to remove part of his spleen and he needed 22 stitches to the top of his head, but he will be all right.”

The white pickup truck — possibly a Toyota — was traveling eastbound on Mesquite Road. Chavez was riding the bike in the same direction when the front of the vehicle struck the rear wheel of the bicycle, ejecting the teen, according to California Highway Patrol spokesman Matt Hunt.

“I can’t believe someone would hit him and leave him there in the road,” Crow said. “He is a human being.”

Crow said her grandson was riding his sister’s bike to the store to get her a bag of chips when he was struck. Crow said she is angry at the driver for failing to stop but she is grateful that her grandson is alive.

“It could have been much worse, like that poor boy who died (Tuesday),” Crow said, referring to Daniel Sanchez, 17, of Hesperia.

Sanchez was also a victim of a hit-and-run while riding a bicycle in Hesperia on Monday about 1:33 a.m.

Though the incidents occurred just four days and less than five miles apart, as well as the suspect’s vehicle having a similar description, there is nothing to indicate the two incidents are related, according to San Bernardino County Sheriff’s officials.

“Everybody makes mistakes,” Crow said. “I just want the person who did this to do the right thing and turn themselves in.”

The CHP is still investigating the incident and anyone with information is asked to contact the Victorville CHP office at 760-241-1186.
