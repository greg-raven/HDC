Thanks to everyone who participated in the Ride for Bike Lanes Monday afternoon (May 3rd, 2010). There was a great turn-out, and it’s a fun ride when you get a critical mass of cyclists all together!

The route of the six-mile ride started at the parking lot next to [Lowe’s and Baja Fresh in Victorville](https://goo.gl/maps/LmiA), and proceeds down Bear Valley Road, ending at the [Automobile Club office in Jess Ranch](https://goo.gl/maps/jivn) Marketplace.
