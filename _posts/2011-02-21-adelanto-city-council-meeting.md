Local super-cyclist Chuck Hanson is on the agenda of this week's Adelanto City Council meeting to talk about bike lanes in Adelanto. The meeting starts at 7:00 PM, and we're urging all cyclists in the high desert to attend to support Chuck. Once there, you too can sign up to address the city council, and voice your opinion. The meeting is open to everyone, not just to residents of Adelanto.

Chuck and Pat Hanson attend many city council meetings around the high desert, trying to raise awareness for cycling and safety.

There is no set time for Chuck to address the council members, but it will be best to arrive early, not only to ensure you get a seat but to sign in if you wish to speak. The Adelanto city council seems to move its meetings along fairly quickly, so you shouldn't have long to wait for the bike lane portion.
