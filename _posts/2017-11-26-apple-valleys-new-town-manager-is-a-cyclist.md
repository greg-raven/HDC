On Tuesday, November 28, the Apple Valley Town Council will vote to hire Doug Robertson as the new Town Manager. The good news is that this would dramatically increase the number of cyclists in Apple Valley government from approximately zero to one, as Robertson is a cyclist.

There are also rumors of a shake-up in the Town Council at the next election which, if true, result in a very cyclist-friendly member of the community acquiring a seat on the Town Council.
