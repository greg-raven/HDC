The 2013 [Peak to Peak Pedal](http://usarc.org/peak-to-peak-pedal), a charity bike ride from Big Bear to Mammoth in support of the [United States Adaptive Recreation Center](http://usarc.org/) (USARC), starts October 9th.  
  
The first two of the five stages go through the high desert: Big Bear to Barstow, and Barstow to Ridgecrest.

Best of luck to all the riders participating!
