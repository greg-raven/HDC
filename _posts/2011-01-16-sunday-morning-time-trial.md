Sorry about the late notice, but there will be a time trial this morning at 8:00 A.M. at [Virginia Park in Apple Valley](https://goo.gl/maps/Ek5E) (on Central, just north of Waalew). It is being put on by members of the Victor Valley Bicycle Club, with an aim toward making this a monthly event. The first riders go off at 8:30. There's no cost, and everyone is welcome.
