PHELAN --- A 29-year-old man riding a bicycle was struck and killed Thursday night on Highway 138 near Gramercy Road in Phelan, according to California Highway Patrol spokesman Matt Hunt.

The San Bernardino County Fire Department and CHP officers responded to a call of a vehicle versus pedestrian at 11:40 p.m., Hunt said.

Max Deanwallace Abraham was riding his bicycle on the eastbound lane of Highway 138 and was struck from behind by a black Chevrolet Tahoe, also traveling east lane, Hunt said.

Abraham, 29, and his bicycle were found approximately four feet into the eastbound lane. He was pronounced dead at the scene, Hunt said.

The driver of the pickup told CHP officers he was unable to avoid Abraham and was traveling approximately 60 miles per hour. The motorist was unharmed in the collision.

Hunt said Abraham is a resident of Sunland in the San Fernando Valley, but the San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner's report lists him as a Wrightwood resident.

Hunt said Abraham was not wearing a helmet or reflectors and the bicycle did not have any lights.

Abraham's death is the second fatal collision in the Victor Valley this month involving a cyclist.

According to the coroner's report, an autopsy will be conducted to determine the exact cause of death. Hunt said CHP is currently investigating the collision.

Anybody with information is asked to contact the CHP station at 760-241-1186, those wishing to remain anonymous can call 800-835-5247.
