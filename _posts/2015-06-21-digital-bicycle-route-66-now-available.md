For years [Adventure Cycling](https://www.adventurecycling.org/) has offered maps to help cross-country cyclists. One of its offerings covered the famous Route 66. Often called “The Main Street of America,” made famous in popular songs, literature, television and movies, “Route 66,” became a reality in 1926 as a highway connecting Chicago and Los Angeles. Locally, it runs through Barstow, Helendale, Victorville, and the Cajon Pass. Between Oatman, Arizona, and Los Angeles are some of the most isolated stretches and busiest urban stretches of Bicycle Route 66. The route ends at the Santa Monica pier on the Pacific Ocean.

Now, Adventure Cycling is offering our local section in digital format as Bicycle Route 66 Digital Section 6: Oatman, AZ – Santa Monica, CA (360 miles), for only $3.75 on-line.

The ZIP file consists of track and service waypoint files in GPX (GPS Exchange Format) file format, and Adventure Cycling has full directions on how to transfer the files to your GPS device.
