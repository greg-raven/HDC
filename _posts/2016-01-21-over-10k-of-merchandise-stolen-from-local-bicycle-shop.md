Authorities: No suspect information or arrests

VICTORVILLE --- San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department authorities continue to search for two suspects who reportedly stole over $10,000 worth of merchandise from a local bicycle shop late Tuesday.

The incident occurred just before 9 p.m. Tuesday at the Victorville Cycles store in the 12000 block of Ridgecrest Road. According to store manager Carol Kraatz, the suspects reportedly used a large crowbar to bend the door frame and enter the store.

"They then backed a U-Haul box van into the entrance and loaded up five very expensive bikes," Kraatz said. "They are very unique bikes made by (bicycle manufacturer) Giant and are full suspension models. It's almost a $13,000 loss."

Kraatz said the burglary was captured on surveillance video footage from the store. The suspects were reportedly seen in the shopping center where the store is located as early as 8 p.m., Kraatz said. She described the suspects as two men, one about 6 feet tall and the other 5 feet, 8 inches tall. Nothing else was taken from the store, she said.

Sheriff's Sgt. Steven Pennington told the Daily Press no further suspect information was available Wednesday and no arrests had yet been made.

Kraatz mentioned that several local business owners have had to deal with similar problems recently. The Daily Press reported on several Victorville and Hesperia businesses that were burglarized just days before Christmas. No suspects have yet been named or arrested for any of those incidents.

Kraatz said the store has been in business since 1974 and Tuesday's burglary was "by far the worst loss we have ever experienced."

"It's devastating," Kraatz said. "We're just trying to pick up the pieces and continue serving the community. Hopefully, someone saw something and provides the information to the Sheriff's Department."

Anyone with information regarding this incident is urged to contact the Victorville Sheriff's station at 760-241-2911.
