Recent studies have shown that multiple lights on your bike are more visible to drivers than a single super-bright light.  
  
Local road and BMX bike shops have a good selection of lights, and Walmart's bicycling section is worth checking out, too. One surprising source for bicycling lights is 99Â¢ Stores. The selection varies from store to store, but you can pick up a handful of lights for next to nothing. The stores we visited have rear lights aplenty, and one even had LED bands that could be worn around the arms or ankles (moving lights have even higher visibility).

See the December 2010 issue of *Bicycling* magazine (pg. 34) for more information about lighting.
